# Concert Tour Assistant



---

## Project Overview

This project implements a **Concert Tour Assistant** â€” a question-answering chatbot specialized in concert tour information.  
The assistant uses a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** approach:

- You upload text documents related to concert tours.
- The assistant retrieves relevant document snippets based on your question.
- It generates a precise answer using a large language model (LLM) hosted on Hugging Face Inference API.

Additionally, there is an optional **Bonus Feature**: if no documents are uploaded but the user inputs an artist or band name, the assistant performs an **online search for upcoming concerts** using the SerpAPI service, providing fresh and relevant information.

## Architecture & Design

### Core Components:

1. **Document Ingestion and Storage**  
   - Documents entered by the user are stored locally in a persistent Chroma vector database.  
   - Text is summarized for quick preview and better relevance filtering.

2. **Retriever**  
   - Uses HuggingFace sentence-transformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) for text embeddings.  
   - Performs similarity search on stored documents.

3. **Generator**  
   - Calls Hugging Face's Inference API with `zephyr-7b-beta` model for answer generation based on retrieved context.

4. **Bonus Online Search (Optional)**  
   - Uses SerpAPI Google Events search engine to find concert info online when no documents are available.

### Technologies:

- Python 3.8+  
- Streamlit for UI  
- LangChain for retrieval & embeddings  
- ChromaDB for vector storage  
- Hugging Face Inference API for LLM  
- SerpAPI for online concert data (optional)  
- dotenv for environment variables management

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArthurMeloyan/ProvectusInternship_ArthurMeloyan.git
cd ProvectusInternship_ArthurMeloyan
```
### 2. Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 3. Create and configure ```.env``` file
Create a ```.env``` file in the root directory with the following keys:
```
HF_API_KEY=your_huggingface_api_toke_here
SERPAPI_API_KEY=your_serpapi_api_key_here
```
- **HF_API_TOKEN:** Obtain from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens). Must have Inference API access.
- **SERPAPI_API_TOKEN:** Obtain from [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/users/sign_up). Needed for online search
### 4. Run the application
```
python main.py
```
Open your browser to the URL provided by Streamlit(usually http://localhost:8501)
## Usage Instructions
### Adding documents
- In the **Add a New document** section, paste any text describing concert tour(e.g. announcements, news articles, schedules).
- Click **Add document** to save it in the vector database.
- A summary of the document will be shown to confirm successful ingestion
### Asking Questions
- In the **Ask question** section, type your query related to concert tours(e.g., *When does Justin Bieber's 2025 tour start?*)
- Click **Get answer** to retrieve a response generated by the LLM based on your uploaded documents.
### Bonus Feature - Online Concert Information Search
- If **no documents** are added but you enter an artist or band name, the assistant will query **SerpAPI** for upcoming concert events.
- This gives you fresh, real-time data about concerts without the need to uploda documents.
- Notes: This requires a valid ```SERPAPI_API_KEY``` in ```.env```

### Design Choices and Considerations
- **Local Vector Storage with ChromaDB**: Enables fast and scalable similarity search without external dependencies.
- **HuggingFace Embeddings + LLM**: Combines strong semantic search with powerful generation, improving answer accuracy.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Core RAG logic is clearly separated from bonus online search for maintainability and modularity.
- **Environment Variables for Secrets**: Keeps API tokens secure and configurable without hardcoding.
- **Streamlit UI**: Provides an easy-to-use interface for demo and testing purposes.
